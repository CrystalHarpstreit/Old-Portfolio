<p>I&#39;ve been learning to program for quite a while now, but I think that starting to blog about
it will really help me solidify what I&#39;ve learned. Let&#39;s talk about this blog, it&#39;s built
with harp.js, a static site generator which you can see <a href="harpjs.com">here</a></p>
<p>A friend mentioned I should try it out for its simplicity. It&#39;s true, it wasn&#39;t hard to
set up, I&#39;d been struggling with Jekyll for some reason (I forget what it was now)
and decided to switch to harp. I like the layout so far and am getting a hang of making
&quot;recipes&quot; with harp. There&#39;s a lot in the cookbook which you can find <a href="http://harpjs.com/recipes/">here</a></p>
<p>Signing out for now...</p>
