I've been learning to program for quite a while now, but I think that starting to blog about
it will really help me solidify what I've learned. Let's talk about this blog, it's built
with harp.js, a static site generator which you can see [here](harpjs.com)

A friend mentioned I should try it out for its simplicity. It's true, it wasn't hard to
set up, I'd been struggling with Jekyll for some reason (I forget what it was now)
and decided to switch to harp. I like the layout so far and am getting a hang of making
"recipes" with harp. There's a lot in the cookbook which you can find [here](http://harpjs.com/recipes/)

Signing out for now...
